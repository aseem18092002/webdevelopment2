  <h2>Some Facts about Cats</h2>
  <h3 class="Middle-head">Cats Can Be Lactose Intolerant</h3>
  <img class="lactose" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQkvJOpcxCq4x5s2yrA2Jin-W3oL8nw4iEyQQ&usqp=CAU" alt="lactose">
  <p>As opposed to the popular belief that cats love milk and they can gulp down a sauce of it in a go, cats are lactose intolerant. Cats are mammals like humans. Both species drink milk in their prime through breastfeeding.

However, eventually, cats lose an enzyme in their body called lactase which helps in the digestion of milk. Hence, they become lactose intolerant. So if you are feeding a stray cat or your cat, keep this in mind. </p>


  <h3 class="Middle-head"> Cats Smell With Their Mouth</h3>
  <img  class="smelling"src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ59_AF52Rnr9khTaT20CzhXE-bKsX7lQWS-A&usqp=CAU" alt="smeling">
  <p>You might have observed when you are eating something or making something to eat, your cats have their mouths open. It is because they smell from their mouth.

The process of opening their mouth, inhaling the smell, and then holding that position is called Flehmen response. </p>
<h3 class="Middle-head"> Domestic Cats Have Similar Features As Tigers</h3>
<img class="Tigers" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ2HBVPsPNk0EDeEQ9NI-HqFg8tIU-CYxON-w&usqp=CAU" alt="Tigers">
<p>According to scientists, 95.6% of DNA is common between domestic cats and tigers! So apart from their size, their appearance, the way of marking territory, and their general habits are entirely safe.

You may have seen cats rubbing their face at doors or sofas, it is their way of marking territory. Similarly, tigers do the same in their natural habitat. Additionally, they both are obligate carnivores which means that they require meat in their diet. </p>
<h3 class="Middle-head">Cats Cannot Taste Sweetness</h3>
<img class="Sweetness" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR2IHnhneyE7hnkL96b4v9drGFEprZE44vIGA&usqp=CAU" alt="Sweetness">
<p>Did you know that cats cannot exactly taste sweetness? It comes as a surprise, especially when they’re the only mammals who cannot do that. However, as per studies, there’s a huge reason behind it.

Cats cannot taste sweetness as one of the two genes responsible for making the sweetness receptor stopped working permanently a few million years ago itself.</p>

  <p class="Cat">The versatility of cat ownership is one reason why so many people enjoy feline companionship. Cats make great pets whether you live in a big house or tiny apartment, and they provide all the fun and play of larger animal companions. If you’re thinking of owning a cat, these are some of the key benefits:</p>
  <h3>Cats are low maintenance </h3>
  <p>Maybe cats’ most alluring quality is that they are lower maintenance and cost less than dogs, who need walking, training, frequent grooming, and more toys and attention. Cats are also perfect for apartments or city living. They don’t need tons of space to play and explore—nosing their way through the nooks and crannies of your kitchen will keep them occupied for hours.</p>
  <h3>They’re quiet</h3>
  <p> Cats tend to meow when they’re hungry, but you rarely have to worry about being woken up or distracted from a task by a cat begging for attention. This makes them an ideal pet if you’re working from home or have youngsters napping during the day.</p>
  <h3>They’re independent</h3>
  <p>A cat will be there for you when you need them but they’re also perfectly adept at entertaining themselves. Most don’t need—or want—constant attention and you’ll never have to endure guilt-inducing puppy eyes from a cat.</p>
  <h3>They have long life spans</h3>
  <p>The most difficult stage of pet ownership is parting with your beloved companion. While you’re still likely to outlive a cat, their longer lifespans mean you’ll get to have more time with them—up to 20 years, in fact.</p>
