  <h1>Types of Dog Breeds </h1>

  <div class="Skill-row">
    <h2>Scottish Dearhound</h2>
    <img class="Image" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTjI6ArJmpflXze0LG7wKbS0TivLi8kizp8Zg&usqp=CAU" alt="Scottish DearHound">
    <p class="Scottish">The original purpose of the Scottish Deerhound dog breed was to hunt and bring down the Scottish roe deer, a magnificent beast twice or more the dog’s size. Today, if the Scottish Deerhound were writing a personals ad, they’d
      say that they enjoy long walks, opportunities to run, regular meals, and a nice sofa to nap on.</p>

  <div class="middle-container">
    <h3 class="kai">Alaskan Klee kai</h3>
    <img class="kle" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQwvmBKgMM9-Oah9kw_k3ZXMwYuDxIl9XHN0g&usqp=CAU" alt="Alaskan">
    <!-- <img class="Image2" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSJxtj1rg_9gf-azdkKpha73SGed-H5daATXQ&usqp=CAU" alt="kai"> -->

    <p class="Klee">Small, smart, and energetic, the Alaskan Klee Kai is a relatively new breed that looks like a smaller version of the Siberian Husky. Even the name “Klee Kai” comes from an Inuit term meaning “small dog.”

      While Alaskan Klee Kais may resemble larger Husky breeds, they have some key differences, especially when it comes to temperament, that distinguish it from its ancestor working class dogs of the north. This breed is more suited to the life of a
      companion; although, the Alaskan Klee Kai shares the high energy of the Husky and demands plenty of exercise.</p>

    <h2>American Eskimo Dog</h2>
    <img class="American" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcReo1dGAnMoH2B-UyPGKyUCBMkch-mCol37ig&usqp=CAU" alt="American">
    <p class="Eskie">Called “the dog beautiful” by admirers, the American Eskimo Dog, or “Eskie,” is a striking canine with their white coat, sweet expression, and black eyes. They’re a Nordic dog breed, a member of the Spitz family.

      Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.
      skies are lively, active companion dogs who love to entertain and join in on all family activities. They’re outgoing and friendly with family and friends, but reserved with strangers. Although the Eskie is a small dog — 10 to 30 pounds — they
      have a big-dog attitude.</p>

  <div class="Bottom-2-container">
    <h2>American Hairless Terrier</h2>
    <img class="Hairless" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSWNErl2kp6wOnSpPM5Ql7Q4Ip_g4Yf1_BUqg&usqp=CAU" alt="Hairless">
    <p>The American Hairless Terrier is the only hairless dog breed indigenous to the United States, and the breed’s creation was something of a happy accident. Today, the breed is known as an active companion dog and an especially great choice for
      allergy sufferers.

      Some fans of the new breed abbreviate the name to AHT, while some refer to them as hairless Rat Terriers. Although these are purebred dogs, you may still find them in shelters and rescues. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if this is the breed for
      you.
      Like all terriers, the American Hairless Terrier is a curious, spunky, and intelligent dog breed. They can thrive in larger family homes with kids or with active urban dwellers in apartments or condos. If you’re looking for a small dog who
      enjoys snuggling, being a goof, and alerting you to potential dangers, the American Hairless Terrier just might be the dog for you!

      DogTime recommends this carrier for traveling with your small American Hairless Terrier.

    <h3>American Foxhound</h3>
    <img class="Foxhound" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKArd1mvJJ4K-j5bqav8ebBTBPrPpoc69BGQ&usqp=CAU" alt="Foxhound">
    <p>Easygoing, sweet, kind, and loyal, the American Foxhound dog breed belongs to a way of life that has continued for more than two centuries, but they have the potential to be a modern-day companion as well.

      Although they’re purebred dogs, you may find American Foxhounds in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. If this is the breed for you, opt to adopt if possible!
      The American Foxhound’s stamina and love of running make them great jogging partners for athletic pet parents, and their mild nature makes them excellent family dogs, so long as they get the exercise they crave. Although they’re low maintenance
      and affectionate pets, apartment dwellers and novice owners should beware. This breed’s energy and intensity mean that they need plenty of space to run and a commitment to lots of active play time.

      DogTime recommends this dog bed to give a good night’s sleep to your medium-sized American Foxhound. You should also pick up this dog water bottle for any outdoor adventures you have with your pup!</p>
